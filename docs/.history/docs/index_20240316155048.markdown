I am a recent graduate from Boston University with a degree in Computer Science. My primary interest in computer science is machine learning. Currently open for any sort of software engineering work. Experience in programming is primarily in Java, Javascript, Python, and OCaml, but have worked with React, Node, Jekyll, Ruby, and more.
