### Some of the projects I have done

Built a differentially private LSTM while I was taking BU Professor [**Adam Smith**](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/adam-smith/)'s course CS 599 S1 Privacy in Statistics and Machine Learning aiming to analyze the effects of utilizing differentially private training method. The final project report can be found [**here**](https://github.com/lelandling/dp-memorization-project/blob/main/memorizationpaper.pdf). In retrospect, I felt like I had a lot of shortcomings when I began this project but am really proud of completing it. If you want to read more about my experience, click [**here**](/about/cs599).

Built a AI generated image classifier for a [**bitgrit competition**](https://bitgrit.net/competition/18) placed 4th/473 participants with a partner and 27th alone. Techniques used to achieve this score include searching the model space for an optimal model (trying various linear classifiers, deep learning, and other techniques), data augmentation, searching the parameter space to optimize the ideal model. Source code for this classifier can be found [**here**](https://github.com/lelandling/bitgritcompetition). 

Built a forecaster for an autocast competition. Competition involved question answering multiple choice, numerical, and true false qustions. To do this, I finetuned three separate DistilBert models for each question type using the training sets provided to us. There was additional resources available for training, but file size was too large for our machine to process. Source code can be found [**here**](https://github.com/lelandling/autocastcomp).
